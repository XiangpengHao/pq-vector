# Engineering principles

1. Think about minimal changes to complete the task.
2. Always cargo check after coding.
3. Consider refactoring when a function needs more than 3 args.
4. When fixing a bug, think from first principles: why it happened, what is the root cause, what is the best place to fix it.

# Agent guides

1. Ask if you think one instruction is ambiguous.
